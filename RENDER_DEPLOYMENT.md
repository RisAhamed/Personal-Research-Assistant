**Variable 3:**
- **Key**: `YOUR_SITE_URL`
- **Value**: `https://your-app-name.onrender.com` 
  - Replace `your-app-name` with your actual service name
  - You can update this after deployment with the actual URL

**Variable 4:**
- **Key**: `YOUR_SITE_NAME`
- **Value**: `Personal Research Assistant`

- **Key**: `GROQ_API_KEY`
- **Value**: Your Groq API key from Step 1.2

**Variable 6:**
- **Key**: `TAVILY_API_KEY`
- **Value**: Your Tavily API key from Step 1.3

**Variable 7:**
- **Key**: `PORT`
- **Value**: `8501`

### 3.2 Verify Environment Variables
Double-check that all 7 environment variables are correctly set:
- ‚úÖ OPENROUTER_API_KEY
- ‚úÖ OPENROUTER_BASE_URL
- ‚úÖ YOUR_SITE_URL
- ‚úÖ YOUR_SITE_NAME
- ‚úÖ GROQ_API_KEY
- ‚úÖ TAVILY_API_KEY
- ‚úÖ PORT

## üöÄ Step 4: Deploy Your Application

### 4.1 Start Deployment
1. Review all your settings one final time
2. Click the **"Create Web Service"** button
3. Render will start building your application

### 4.2 Monitor Build Process
1. You'll be redirected to your service dashboard
2. Watch the **"Logs"** tab for build progress
3. The build process typically takes 5-10 minutes for first deployment

**Expected Build Stages:**
1. üì• **Cloning repository** from GitHub
2. üê≥ **Building Docker image** (multi-stage build)
3. üì¶ **Installing dependencies** via pip-tools
4. ‚úÖ **Build completed**
5. üöÄ **Starting service**

### 4.3 Verify Successful Deployment
1. Wait for the status to show **"Live"** (green indicator)
2. Click on your service URL (e.g., `https://your-app-name.onrender.com`)
3. You should see the Streamlit interface

---

## üîß Step 5: Test Your Application

### 5.1 Basic Functionality Test
1. Access your deployed application
2. Enter a test research topic (e.g., "Benefits of renewable energy")
3. Click **"Start Research"**
4. Verify that:
   - ‚úÖ Research plan is generated
   - ‚úÖ Execution steps show progress
   - ‚úÖ Final report is produced

### 5.2 Update YOUR_SITE_URL (Important!)
1. Go back to your Render service dashboard
2. Go to **"Environment"** tab
3. Find the `YOUR_SITE_URL` variable
4. Update it with your actual Render URL (e.g., `https://research-assistant-xyz.onrender.com`)
5. Click **"Save Changes"**
6. The service will automatically redeploy

---

## üîÑ Step 6: Enable Auto-Deployment (Optional)

### 6.1 Verify Auto-Deploy Settings
1. In your Render service dashboard
2. Go to **"Settings"** tab
3. Ensure **"Auto-Deploy"** is set to **"Yes"**

### 6.2 Test Auto-Deployment
1. Make a small change to your README.md locally
2. Commit and push to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "test: verify auto-deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```
3. Watch your Render service automatically redeploy

---

## üìä Step 7: Monitor Your Application

### 7.1 Access Service Metrics
1. In your Render dashboard, go to **"Metrics"** tab
2. Monitor:
   - **Response Time**
   - **CPU Usage**
   - **Memory Usage**
   - **Request Count**

### 7.2 Check Logs for Issues
1. Go to **"Logs"** tab
2. Monitor for any errors or warnings
3. Common issues to watch for:
   - API key errors
   - Rate limiting issues
   - Memory usage spikes

## üö® Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: Build Fails
**Symptoms:** Build fails during Docker build stage
**Solutions:**
- Check that `Dockerfile` is in repository root
- Verify `requirements.in` has all necessary dependencies
- Check build logs for specific error messages

### Issue 2: Application Won't Start
**Symptoms:** Build succeeds but service shows as "Build failed"
**Solutions:**
- Verify `PORT` environment variable is set to `8501`
- Check that Streamlit is properly configured in Dockerfile
- Review startup logs for Python import errors

### Issue 3: API Errors
**Symptoms:** Application starts but research fails
**Solutions:**
- Verify all API keys are correctly set
- Check API key quotas and limits
- Test API keys individually with simple requests

### Issue 4: Slow Performance
**Symptoms:** Application is very slow to respond
**Solutions:**
- Consider upgrading to a paid Render plan
- Optimize your research queries
- Check if APIs have rate limiting

### Issue 5: Service Goes to Sleep
**Symptoms:** First request after inactivity is very slow
**Solutions:**
- This is normal for free tier (services sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity)
- Consider upgrading to paid plan for always-on service
- Use a service like UptimeRobot to ping your app periodically

## üîß Step 8: Optional Enhancements

### 8.1 Custom Domain (Paid Plans)
1. Go to **"Settings"** ‚Üí **"Custom Domains"**
2. Add your domain and configure DNS
3. SSL certificates are automatically managed

### 8.2 Deploy Hooks for CI/CD
1. Go to **"Settings"** ‚Üí **"Deploy Hooks"**
2. Copy the webhook URL
3. Add as `RENDER_DEPLOY_HOOK_URL` secret in GitHub
4. Enables controlled deployments via GitHub Actions

### 8.3 Database Integration
If you need persistent storage:
1. Create a **PostgreSQL** service in Render
2. Add database connection string to environment variables
3. Modify your application to use database

---

## üìà Scaling Considerations

### Free Tier Limitations
- **750 hours/month** of runtime
- **Services sleep** after 15 minutes of inactivity
- **Limited CPU/memory** resources
- **No always-on** guarantee

### When to Upgrade
Consider upgrading when you experience:
- Frequent cold starts affecting user experience
- Hitting the 750-hour monthly limit
- Need for guaranteed uptime
- Performance issues under load
